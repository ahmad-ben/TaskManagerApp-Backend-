# Notes Not It  

**Notes Not It** is a modern task manager app designed to help you stay organized and productive. While inspired by ideas from [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjdNHWULhPSZFDzQU6AnbVQNNo1NTRpd), the app goes beyond the basics by adding:  

- Enhanced **security features** like login/logout and session handling.  
- Better **responsiveness** for a smooth experience across all devices.  
- Thoughtful handling of **edge cases** such as:  
  - Empty task lists, with explanatory messages.
  - Custom error pages for invalid URLs or unexpected actions.

## 🌟 Features  

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks.  
- **Secure Authentication**: Login/logout functionality to protect your data.  
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- **Edge Case Handling**: Intuitive messaging for empty states and error scenarios.  

## 🎨 What Sets It Apart  

This app isn't a simple reproduction of the playlist's content. I expanded on the foundational ideas with my own features and improvements to make it more robust, secure, and user-friendly.  

## 🔧 Technologies  

- **Frontend**: Angular  
- **Backend**: Node.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB
